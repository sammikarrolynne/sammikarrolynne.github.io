Hi! I'm Sammi Gibson. I have a BA in English from Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC). I have nearly 10 years of experience in customer service, meaning I have good communication skills and know how to work with people. I've held leadership positions, such as vice president and president of TAMU-CC's English Club. While in those positions, I was in charge of setting up meetings and events and keeping up with our social media presence. I'm excited to transfer my skills into the field of technical writing!
