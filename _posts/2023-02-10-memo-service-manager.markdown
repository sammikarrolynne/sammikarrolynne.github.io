Memo

To: All Employees

From: Sammi Gibson

CC: Management

Subject: Employee Back Work


I am writing to inform everyone of what I have been noticing the last few weeks regarding everyoneâ€™s back-work after they have been cut. First, I want to say, keep up the good work. Most everyone has been doing their part to keep our restaurant in tip-top shape. That being said, we need to make sure we are doing the work we are assigned. That means no trading back work and no paying others to do your back-work for you. 

As our restaurant continues to grow, it is becoming more important that management can keep track of who is doing what and for everything to be done in a timely manner. If you are doing more than just your own back-work, whether someone has paid you or not, it will take you longer to finish. It also complicates things for the employee assigned to check everyone out at the end of the night. Trading duties has led to some employees leaving without doing their share because someone else has done their job for them enabling them to get signed out, while the other person could not because their assigned work had not been done. 

Should you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask management. 

Thank you for your cooperation!

Sincerely,

Sammi Gibson, Service Manager
